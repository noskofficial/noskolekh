## Image Display and Rendering 

1. ### Image Display Techniques 

Image display techniques are fundamental to computer graphics as they determine how images are rendered and presented to the viewer. One common technique is rasterization, which involves converting 3D objects and scenes into a 2D image composed of pixels. This process involves projecting 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane and assigning colors or textures to the resulting pixels.


Another technique is ray tracing, which simulates the behavior of light rays in a scene to calculate the color and intensity of each pixel. Ray tracing produces more realistic and accurate images by considering factors such as reflections, refractions, and shadows.


2. ### Real-Time Rendering 

Real-time rendering is a crucial aspect of computer graphics, especially in interactive applications such as video games and virtual reality. Real-time rendering aims to generate and display images at a sufficiently high frame rate to create the illusion of smooth motion. This requires efficient algorithms and hardware optimizations to handle complex scenes and lighting calculations in real-time.


Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) play a vital role in real-time rendering as they are specifically designed to handle the parallel processing requirements of computer graphics. GPUs excel at performing calculations for rendering multiple objects and applying complex shaders and effects.


3. ### Ray Tracing 

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the behavior of light rays in a scene to generate realistic images. It traces the path of light rays from the camera through each pixel, interacting with objects in the scene to calculate their color and intensity. Ray tracing accounts for effects such as reflections, refractions, and shadows, resulting in highly realistic images.


Ray tracing has traditionally been computationally expensive and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-time applications. However, advancements in hardware, such as the introduction of dedicated ray tracing hardware in GPUs, have made real-time ray tracing feasible.
